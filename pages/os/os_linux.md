## Terminologies

- **Application** running in user space can access kernel resources by directly 
invoking Linux system calls or by invoking libc (or glibc)-provided API calls. 
In the latter case, libc (or glibc) invokes a Linux system call. 
  
- **Drivers** in user space can directly access hardware, can access a Linux 
system call, or can access libc (or glibc) APIs. libc (or glibc) is an example 
library running in user space; there are many more such user space libraries.
  
- `bash` is a Unix shell, a user command line interface (CLI).
It is the default shell on Debian OS.
