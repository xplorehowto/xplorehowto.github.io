## Fundamentals & Theoretical

- **[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}
  by [Michael Nielsen](http://cognitivemedium.com/){:target="_blank"}.**  
  Discuss the core principles of neural networks and deep learning; 
  very thorough with simulation and python code examples in 
  [Github](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning){:target="_blank"}; 
  Could take a while to read but well worth it.

- **[Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/){:target="_blank"}; MIT Press book;**
  by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.  
  Require background in mathematics and computer science;
  Target audiences include university students taking machine learning courses; 
  beginning a career in deep learning and artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence research; 
  software engineers with no machine learning or statistics background but  
  begin development using deep learning for product or platform. 

- **[Dive into Deep Learning](http://www.d2l.ai/index.html){:target="_blank"}**
  Online; Open Source; by Zhang et. al.
  Looks good but have not reviewed;
  
## Convolutional Neural Network

- **Stanford CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition**  
  [Notes](http://cs231n.github.io/){:target="_blank"}; 
  [Lecture Collection Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv){:target="_blank"}

## Frameworks

- **[Gluon MXNet - Deep Learning - The Straight Dope](https://gluon.mxnet.io/index.html?source=post_page---------------------------){:target="_blank"}**
  Online; Open Source; by Gluon MXNet
  Looks good with very wide topic coverage;
