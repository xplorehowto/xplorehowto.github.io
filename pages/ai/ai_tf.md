## Tensorflow Core

Tensorflow core is an open source machine learning (ML) framework for developing
models, training, and utilizing trained model to evaluate new input data.  
  
The machine learning development lifecycle includes: data validation & 
processing, feature engineering, ML model development, model training & 
evaluation, serving trained model in production, and continuous data gathering &
retraining for further model refinements.
