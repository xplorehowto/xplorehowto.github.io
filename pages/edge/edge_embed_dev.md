## Introduction

Learning embedded development is best with hands-on directly on the development 
board.

    Kinetis速 KW41Z-2.4 GHz Dual Mode: Bluetooth速 Low Energy and 
    802.15.4 Wireless Radio Microcontroller (MCU) based on Arm速 Cortex速-M0+ 
    Core;  
    In addition, an assortment of on-chip subsystems including: serial ports, 
    I/O ports, timers, and other devices commonly used in deeply embedded 
    devices, flash and RAM memory, signal conditioning circuitry, and 
    connectors needed to support the on-chip I/O devices, onboard JTAG 
    debugging interface, making it easy to download and debug programs without 
    the need for additional tools.
